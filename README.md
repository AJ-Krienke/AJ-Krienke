<h3>Hello, and welcome to my profile</h3>
<h1>My name is AJ Krienke</h1>
<h2>
  I am an aspiring frontend developer with a fascination and a curiosity for
  code
</h2>
<p>
  My first exposure to software was when I was a kid and a friend of mine who
  knew a little q-basic, made a program that asked for your name, and any name
  entered would say that person sucked, when he entered his name, it would say that
  he ruled.
</p>
<p>
  It was an experience I would never forget. It was a simple little program but
  no matter how many times I tried, I could not get this program to tell me I
  ruled.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since that day I have been fascinated by how much you can do with just a
  few lines of text. Everything from create a beautiful design, to a system that
  interfaces with physical devices, to connecting 2 computers which are half way
  across the world and can talk to each other
</p>

<h3>
  I studied the following in pursuit of my aspirations, which led me to want to
  become a web dev
