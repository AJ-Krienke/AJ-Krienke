<h3>Hello, and welcome to my profile</h3>
<h1>My name is AJ Krienke</h1>
<h2>
  I am an aspiring full-stack developer with a fascination and a curiosity for
  code
</h2>
<p>
  My first exposure to software was when I was a child . A friend of mine who
  knew a little q-basic, made a program that asked for a name, any name entered would
  display a cheeky message. When he entered his name it would always say he ruled.
</p>
<p>
  It was an experience I would never forget. It was a simple little program but
  no matter how many times I tried, I could not get this program to tell me I
  ruled, I was hooked.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since that day I have been fascinated by how much you can do with just a
  few lines of text. Everything from create a beautiful design, to a system that
  interfaces with physical devices, to enabling two computers which are half way
  across the world to talk to each other.
